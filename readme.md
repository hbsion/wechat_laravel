## An application for Wifi Control on Wechat by using Laravel Framework and overtrue Wechat Sdk  

### Laravel Framework
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.
Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

#### Document

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### overture Wechat Sdk

可能是目前最优雅的微信公众平台 SDK 了。Laravel 5 拓展包: overtrue/laravel-wechat。

项目存在后的各种优点：

自定义缓存方式；
符合 PSR-4 标准，你可以各种方便的与你的框架集成；
高度抽象的消息类，免去各种拼json与xml的痛苦。
